- Access to gitlab.mediforprogram.com repositories relevant to deployment.
- Access to mediforprogram.com/wiki pages relevant to deployment.
- Access to deployment documentation and relevant program mailing lists.
- Assistance selecting relevant analytics for specific operational needs.
- Weekly touch-point meetings to assess status of efforts and emergent needs.
- Monthly releases addressing minor issues (not feature requests) identified in meetings.
